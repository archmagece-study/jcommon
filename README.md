internal and open source.

## Requirements

jcommon builds and is tested on both Java 8 and Java 11.

## Building jcommon

Maven `pom.xml` files are provided as a convenience. However, we
do not regularly test them, and do not consider them supported.

## Additional information

We do not guarantee API or ABI stability. We do not tag specific
versions, and no longer publish artifacts to Maven Central.

Pull requests are permitted, but not regularly reviewed.
