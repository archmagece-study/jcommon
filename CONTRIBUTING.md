# Contributing to jcommon

## Our Development Process

jcommon is primarily developed internally at Facebook, where
an automated process occasionally pushes changes to GitHub.

## Pull Requests

To submit a pull request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

Pull requests are not regularly reviewed.
